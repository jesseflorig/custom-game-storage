# Custom Game Storage `BETA`
The original collection of open source custom gaming storage.

This project sports the `BETA` tag because I'm still finalizing a standard format and some of the designs are still being ironed out. Please use at your own risk. As the storage designs get to a point that I'm comfortable in backing them, I'll create a list of games that are production ready. I just wanted to get these files out in the open as soon as possible for people to tinker with. Thanks for understanding!

## Layer Colors
The files contain a number of different color shapes. Here's what they mean:
* **BLACK** - cutout shapes
* **BLUE** - light cuts or etching
* **GREEN** - felt cutouts; no output unless you are cutting felt (in wich case only this layer is output)
* **RED** - miscellaneous guides; no output

Typically, any file that contains a felt layer will also have a spacially minimized version for cutting the felt.

## Materials
All storage designs are made to be cut out of 1/8" material. Looks great in hardboard, craft wood and acrylic.

Felt designs are made for cutting out sticky-back *stiff* felt.

## Use
Feel free to cut them out for yourself, cut 'em out for your friends, or cut 'em out to sell to strangers! I don't really care as long as they provide good homes to great games!

## Hey, where's all the fancy art?
Unfortunately none of these are officially licensed for any games, so I can't include any of the copyrighted art in the files. I'm seeking permission from publishers, so this may change in the future.
